My First Expedition
My first computer was the Commodore VIC-20, followed by the C64 and the Amiga 1000. I discovered the love for gaming and haven't looked back. Currently I'm a Sony PlayStation fan and own a Library from each consecutive platform, totalling 600+ titles. 
I started supporting Networks back in 2001 and have seen the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, when it comes to network configurations. Back then, I had to be the Jack of All Trades, which was frowned upon, because Specialist is what distinguished the incumbent's technical prowess. 
Today, how ironic that I was way ahead of the curve, where one has to constantly impress their employer with the scope of knowledge in order to secure and maintain a gig.
